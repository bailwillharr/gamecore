CURRENTLY BROKEN

PROPOSED INTERFACE:

For now, don't allow removing files. Just delete the .gcpak file and re-add everything.

CLI

options:
-a add a file
-t override type (SPIRV_SHADER, TEXTURE_RGB_PNG, TEXTURE_RGB_BC7, etc)
-n specify asset name

When overriding the type, file extension checking is done.
If the file is a .png and BC7 is requested, the texture is compressed.

Command line usage:

gcpak shaders.gcpak
Lists contents of shaders.gcpak

EXAMPLES:

gcpak -a terrain.vert shaders.gcpak
Compiles shader with compile_shaders and adds the compiled shader to shaders.gcpak using:
  asset type: SPIRV_SHADER
  asset name: terrain
Emits a warning if the asset was overwritten.
Creates the gcpak file if it doesn't already exist.
