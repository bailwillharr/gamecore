Positive Z is the up direction
Negative Y is the forward direction
Positive X is the right direction
This is a right-handed Z-up coordinate system, matching Blender and 3DS Max.

Cameras work a bit differently:
Their forward direction is -Z (so by default a camera is facing down in world space)
Their right direction is +X
Their up direction is +Y

In Vulkan, UV coordinates start at the top-left of an image.
For meshes in this engine, the vertex shader flips the V coordinate so that UVs start at the bottom-left.
This is to match the convention of virtually all assets available and is what Blender and 3DS Max use.
