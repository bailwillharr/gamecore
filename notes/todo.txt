Add FrameStates to the ecs to make systems self-contained
	FrameStates would be immutable things like KeyboardInput, MouseInput, DeltaTime
	and also mutable things like DrawData
	(Should a mutable FrameState be allowed to be modified by multiple systems?
	This would introduce dependencies between systems in addition to the component dependencies)

Pipeline variants
	If a given material doesn't use a normal map, for example, it shouldn't sample a normal texture in the fragment shader.
	Use multiple pipelines instead or maybe just use null descriptors.
	Either way, don't store pipeline in material, just what features are wanted, such as:
	 - use normal map
	 - constant roughness vs roughness map
