Add FrameStates to the ecs to make systems self-contained
	FrameStates would be immutable things like KeyboardInput, MouseInput, DeltaTime
	and also mutable things like DrawData
	(Should a mutable FrameState be allowed to be modified by multiple systems?
	This would introduce dependencies between systems in addition to the component dependencies)

Create a ResourceManager<T> that for any given resource type knows how to automatically construct it
	I may need to create manifests for every resource showing how they are made and from what asset files
	and from what other resources the Resource depends on. Manifests could be stored as assets too.
	E.g., A ResourceManager<Material> would have the recipe for making a Material.
	The manifest would contain the names of the shader RESOURCES and texture RESOURCES.
	The ResourceManager<Material> recipe would then call ResourceManager<Shader>::getResource(manifest.shader_name)
	which would create the shader resource.
	A ResourceManager<Texture> manifest would contain the asset name for the texture asset, its size, and possibly also format.
