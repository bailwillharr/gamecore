To present:
acquireAndPresent(VkImage image, VkFence copy_finished);

In a renderer the source image will be remade every frame. It will only need to be recreated when the swapchain is resized (recreated).

You want N frames in flight. acquireAndPresent() should not care about frames in flight and should not deal with that.

You need to know when acquireAndPresent has finished copying the image to know when the image can be reused for the Nth later frame.

It should be possible to make the GPU copy in acquireAndPresent() wait for a semaphore to be signalled, to indicate that the image is ready.

Possible solution:
	acquireAndPresent takes a timeline semaphore and value, and waits for the semaphore to reach that value in order to begin the copy.
